# Introduction

mod_bwcap is a very simple module for capping bandwidth in Apache 2.x.

Bandwidth is measured for all outgoing traffic on the server and when a (configurable) threshold is met, mod_bwcap starts returning 503s (service unavailable) for all requests.

I wrote mod_bwcap so I could have an extremely simple way to cap bandwidth for my entire server.  modbw_cap would be useful in a situation where you may be required to pay huge amounts of money if your hosted application serves more data than you expected.

# Installing

Simply run `make` in the root directory.  This will compile *and* install the module into httpd.  Make sure you have `apxs` in your `PATH` (`apxs` lives in the `bin/` directory of your httpd installation).

# Configuration (httpd.conf)

    ModuleBWCapBandwidthCap 100 #Caps bandwidth at 100 bytes.

    #Stores the scoreboard file in your home directory.
    #The scoreboard file is required so that we have a place to remember the amount of bandwidth used between server restarts.
